# Pong-final

The above project is a python implementation of the famous game Pong, a table tennis-themed arcade video game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari, with two modes available where players can play against one another by opening and running the file progress pong and can play against the computer by opening and running the file automatic pong.

* Make sure the package 'pygame' is installed in the IDE.
